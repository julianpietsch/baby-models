# Models for the Birth Annotator for Budding Yeast algorithm

This repository holds the latest versions of the standard models for BABY -
the Birth Annotator for Budding Yeast. It is not intended to be directly
downloaded, but models will be automatically obtained from this repository if
you have correctly installed the BABY python package.

See the [BABY repository](https://gitlab.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/swainlab/baby) for more
details on the algorithm and installation of the BABY software.

The algorithm is described in:
